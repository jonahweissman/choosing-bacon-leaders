# Process

1. Presidents announce beginning of leadership selection process and
   the [list of desired qualities](qualities.md)
2. Anyone can sign up to join a public list of candidates
3. Current presidents reach out the candidates and find a time for a
   president to meet with each candidate in an open setting.
4. During each meeting, the president asks a pre-selected list of questions
   that are designed to guage the candidate on the list of qualities. The
   president also creates a recording of the meeting. Anyone can sit in on the
   interview, but the recording is kept private
5. Based on the recording and their knowledge of the candidate, each president
   independently rates how well each candidate fits each quality. The ratings
   are averaged.
6. Every senior leader participates in a closed meeting.
   * Everyone in this meeting has access to the anonymized rankings for each
     candidate
   * Leaders write down private initial votes, then discuss. Afterwards, they
     may change their initial votes
   * All except the presidents votes on who should be selected. Everyone gets
     two votes.
   * In general, the top two most voted become president.  If there are three
     obvious leaders, they will all be presidents.  If there are more than
     three obvious leaders it comes down to the three most voted.  The
     presidents have discretion over whether a candidate is an obvious winner
     based on the votes
   * The votes totals (still anonymized) become public after the process is
     over
7. The current presidents announce the de-anonymized winners to Dr. Shields and
   make sure that he is okay with the outcome.
8. The newly-elected presidents assist in choosing leadership for the next
   year, which happens at the sub-group level after the process is over. The
   sub-groups are in charge of deciding this amongst themselves, with the new
   presidents arbitrating in case of complications.
